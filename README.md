# PHP Sample Code

I wrote this portal, using PHP, for a client who needed a secure place for clients to login and upload their documents. Via email, the client's customer was directed to a URL where they could create their account. Upon account creation they were automatically logged into the portal. My client also needed a way for her customer's to sign off on the company terms and conditions. This information is the first thing visible on the Dashboard and will persist until the customer checks the acknowledgement box.

This code has been modified to protect the confidentiality of my client.
